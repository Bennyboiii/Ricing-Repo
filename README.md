# Ricing-Repo
I plan to put a lot of python scripts here, so you can rice not only Linux, but Windows and Mac as well.

<b>NUMBER 1:</b> PyVisV1, a desktop visualizer. everything is explained in the code itself, you can import everything
in the code yourself, this may change once i figure out how to use this bloody site. Meanwhile here is the comment at the start of the program.

WINDOWS USERS:
 - python 3.8 is required to run this
 - pip3 install pygame pyaudio numpy 
 - you may need to install visual studio C++ (Version 14+)

MACOS USERS:
 - python 3.8 is required to run this
 - pip3 install pygame pyaudio numpy

PyVis developed by Ben Cochrane

This program is a visualizer which
does not require an audio processing server
(like MPD or pulseaudio), instead processes
audio inputs automatically. if you want to
make it display desktop audio, you can
download a 3rd party driver ( e. g Virtual Audio Cable)
which does not require any configuration.
It only works on Windows for now, however
it has the potential to be compatible with
MacOS (update, it works on Mac) and most Linux Distros.
I may add an ANSI Terminal mode for ricing as well.

INSTRUCTIONS:
First, Type the width and the height of the
window you want into the dialog box
(tuple separated by a comma, no parentheses)
then, type the position on the screen you want
the window to be at (same tuple format).
Type a 3 number RGB value in the window
(Individual numbers separated by a comma)
, and press ENTER to change the Bar Colour,
or press RSHIFT to change the background
colour. The J, K and L buttons change the
placement of the bars, and the D button
makes it go disco.
